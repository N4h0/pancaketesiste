## Sections: 

## 1. Overview
### For this assignment, we have chosen the option b: Website for a restaurant / cafe. The name of the cafe is Pancake House, and makes the best pancakes in the world! 

### Our webpage is consist of four pages: Home, Menu, About and Contact. We have also included the report.html in the navigation bar in order to make it more accessable and to meet the oblig-criterias. 


## 2. Key elements
### We wanted to create a simple but powerful and beautiful website with minimalistic design, and we have also challenged ourselves to implement some advanced css-styles and effects as seen on the index.html where  backdrop-filter: blur code is used to make the text more readable.
