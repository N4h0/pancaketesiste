     <h1>Welcome to Pancake House, where we aim to bring pancakes to the next level</h1>

     <p>Our restaurant was founded in 2012, with one core belief: the pancake is the ultimate dish. </p> 
     <p>Of couse, we have a lot of condiments to showcase our pancakes. 100% Norwegian bacon, ice cream freshly made at our house, delishous syrup from Japan, Canada and Germany and juicy, sweet berries, to mention some. 
      We work to create dishes with amazing taste, feel and presentation.   </p>
     <p>The dream of creating a resturant dedicated to pancakes started in 2001, and by 2011 our plans were set in motion. United by our love for great food, good presentation, 
      and most importantly pancakes, we created Pancake House. Come visit us to see what pancakes are truly capable of.</p>
     <p>We hope to see you at Pilestredet 35.</p>

     <h2>Meet the crew</h2>

     <p>In 2001, Sirin (center of the picture) got second place in MasterChef australia with her 3 course pancake dish. She felt that she had failed the pancake, and wanted redemtion. 
      After a plan 10 years in the making, she cofounded Pancake House together with the people shown in the picture. Left to right, the team consists of:

     <p> Ahmet (Kitchen manager). Ahmet recived his education at "Norsk Resturantskole" in 2011, and his passion lies in presentation of food. He claims presentation is half the experience of a good meal. </p>
     <p> Gilhan (Executive Chef). When not uploading his coding projects to github, Gilhan can be found experimenting with new and creative ways to showcase the pancake. </p>
     <p> Sirin (General Manager). Sirin is the manager at Pancake house, and makes the wheels go around. "Every kitchen needs a Sirin" - Bhiravina </p>
     <p> Johan (Head of Dishwashing). "I've always hated dirty dishes, which is why this job is perfect for me!"</p>
     <p> Bhiravina (Sous Chef). "The most important part of a successfull dish starts before any ingredients are mixed." </p>
